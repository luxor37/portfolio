# My Portfolio 2.0

This project is to ultimately remake my personal portfolio into something I can be proud of and that can be easily maintained.

As of now, the live version of my portfolio is an old project I made before university and has no framework or anything fancier. The whole thing is made out of pure php and it is as disgusting as you can imagine (https://rmartel.dev).

My intention for this project is to familiarise myself with the Orchard core CMS for ASP.NET core. I chose this perticular CMS because it works with ASP.NET CORE and it has multilangual features (I need myu portfolio to be in french and english!). I plan on making a clean front end that is responsive for all formats and to make my website more secure.

Also, although there wil be a CMS to edit content on the fly, I want to play a bit with DevOps and so I will fully integrate this website on a CI/CD pipeline with Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins once it works locally.
